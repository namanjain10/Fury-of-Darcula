<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This is a simplified version of the game
"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fury_of_Dracula">The Fury of Dracula</a>".
The game involves the arch-vampire Dracula, four intrepid
vampire Hunters and the splendid cities of Victorian Europe.
The aim for the hunters is to kill Dracula before he releases
hordes of vampires over Europe.
The aim for Dracula is to evade the hunters long enough to
realise his Grand Plan (to release hordes of vampires over Europe).
</p>

<h2>How the Game works</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
Dracula and the Hunters move around the cities and seas of
Europe. Every time a Hunter moves into the same city as
Dracula they have an <i>encounter</i> and
Dracula loses some blood. The catch is Dracula knows
where the hunters are but the Hunters do not know where Dracula is.
But he does leave clues... for if a Hunter enters a city where
Dracula has been in any of his last 6 turns then the Hunter discovers
traces of his passing and can deduce precisely when he was
there. For this reason Dracula's last 6 moves are
called his <i>trail</i>.</p>

<p>The Hunters work as a team, spreading out and hunting for
Dracula. At the start of the game they have a score of
366 points, every turn that passes the score slowly
diminishes. The Hunters need to kill Dracula before they
are reduced to an embarrassingly small score.</p>

<h3>The fine print</h3>

<p>Dracula's primary goal is to evade the Hunters, and thus avoid
being staked.
However, Dracula also leaves nasty surprises (<i>traps</i> and
<i>immature Vampires</i>) behind him in every city he visits.
Traps are slightly harmful things like wolves
or mysterious sugar bowls or sinister pot plants.
Sometimes traps are called "minions" (not be confused with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minions_(film)">these</a>).
When a Hunter encounters a Trap the Hunter loses a few life points.
Every 13 rounds Dracula leaves behind a new immature Vampire, sleeping
away. After 6 rounds the Vampire <i>matures</i>; it wakes up and flies
away to wreak havoc and the game score is reduced by 13 points.
However, if any Hunter can get to the city where the Vampire is
sleeping before it matures, they can stake it and save the points
(and make the world a nicer place in which to live).
Note that Dracula places a Trap/Vampire as soon as he enters
a city (i.e. as his <i>action</i> (see below)), not when he leaves
the city.</p>

<p>If a Hunter loses all their life points they are magically
transported to the Hospital St Joseph and St Mary and next turn
they are back to full health. On the other hand if Dracula
loses all <i>his</i> blood then he is vanquished.  </p>

<p>Hunters can move by road, rail, or sea. Dracula can
only move by road or sea. He hates trains. Actually
he is not all that keen on moving water either and every turn he
spends at sea loses him 2 blood points.</p>

<p>Moving by road means moving from one city to another city it is
directly connected to by a single road segment. Moving
by rail is less reliable, sometimes Hunters can move up to 3 rail
segments at a time, sometimes 2, 1, or 0.</p>

<p>Moving by sea is neat; you can rapidly travel a long
way. Unfortunately Hunters can never encounter Dracula
while they are at sea. Even if he is in the same sea as
a Hunter the two always pass each other unknowingly, like ships in
the night. Furthermore Hunters are not even able to
discover whether the sea they are passing through is in Dracula's
trail or not. To balance this Hunters know whenever Dracula goes
to sea and whenever he lands again at a city.</p>

<h4>Poor Dracula</h4>

<p>Dracula's movement is much more constrained than the
Hunters'. </p>

<p>In particular he can't make any <b>MOVE</b> currently in his trail.
This generally means he can't revisit any city or sea in his trail,
except by making a <b>HIDE</b> or <b>DOUBLE_BACK</b> move: </p>

<ul>
<li>he may make a 
	<b>HIDE</b> move and remain in the
	city he is currently in for a second turn.  He
	cannot <b>HIDE</b> at
	sea. Dracula can
	only have one <b>HIDE</b> move
	in his trail at any time.</li> 
<li>he may make
	a <b>DOUBLE_BACK</b> move
	and revisit one city or sea in his trail, however whenever
	he makes a 
	<b>DOUBLE_BACK</b> move the Hunters
	know he has done so. 
	Dracula can only have
	one <b>DOUBLE_BACK</b> move
	in his trail at any time.</li> 
</ul>
<p>Once the location move has fallen off his trail he may make
that move again (i.e. move back to that location) even if a 
<b>HIDE</b> or <b>DOUBLE_BACK</b> move for that location
remains in the trail.</p>


<h2>The Rules of the Game</h2>

<h2>Score</h2>

<ul>
	
<li>The game score starts at 366 points.</li> 
<li>The score decreases by 1 each time Dracula finishes a turn.</li>
<li>The score decreases by 6 each time a Hunter is teleported
	to the hospital.</li> 
<li>The score decreases by 13 each
	time a Vampire matures (ie falls off the trail).</li>
<li>Dracula wants the score to be low, the Hunters want the
	score to be high.</li> 
<li>The game will normally finish
	before the score reaches zero, however if it ever reaches
	0 we say Dracula has utterly won, the world is doomed, and
	the game stops at once. We all look accusingly
	at the Hunters...</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dracula</h2>

<ul>
	
<li>Dracula starts with 40 blood points.</li> 
<li>Dracula loses 10 blood points each time he encounters a Hunter.</li>
<li>Dracula loses 2 blood points if he is at sea at the end
	of his turn (he hates water!)</li> 
<li>Dracula regains 10
	blood points if he is in Castle Dracula at the end of his
	turn and has not yet been defeated (even if he has been
	automagically teleported there - see Dracula's Turn below)
	<ul>
	<li><i>Dracula is permitted to exceed 40 blood points</i></li>
	</ul>
</li> 
<li>When Dracula has no blood points left the
	game is over and the score at that time becomes the final
	score.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hunters</h2>

<ul>
<li>There are 4 Hunters: <i>Lord Godalming</i>, <i>Dr.
	Seward</i>, <i>Van Helsing</i>, and <i>Mina Harker</i></li>
<li>Each starts with 9 life points</li> 
<li>If a Hunter
	encounters a Trap this causes the Hunter to lose 2 life
	points</li> 
<li>A Hunter loses 4 life points every time
	he/she encounters Dracula.</li> 
<li>A Hunter gains 3 life
	points each time they rest in a city (ie if they end their
	turn in the same city they ended their previous turn in)
	<ul>
	<li><i>Hunters are not permitted to exceed 9 life points</i></li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sequence of play</h2>

<ul>
<li>
In a round of the game each of the five characters has
their turn in the sequence:
<ul>
<li>Lord Godalming,</li>
<li>Dr. Seward,</li>
<li>Van Helsing,</li>
<li>Mina Harker,</li>
<li>and then Dracula has his turn.</li>
</ul>
and then the same again for the next round, and so on.
</li>

<li>
Each character's turn consists of a <b>MOVE</b>
and then (possibly) some <b>ACTION</b>.
</li>

<li>
In the first round each character can <b>MOVE</b>
to whichever location they like except that Dracula
cannot move to the Hospital of St Joseph and St Mary
(too many crucifixes).
</li>

<li>
The game finishes if and when at the
end of any turn Dracula has been reduced to 0 blood points
or less, or the game score has been reduced to 0 points or
less.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hunter's Turn</h2>

<h3>Hunter's Move</h3>

<ul>
<li><i>Road moves</i>: a Hunter can
	move to any city directly connected to the current city by
	a road.</li> 
<li><i>Sea moves</i>: a
	Hunter can move from a port to an adjacent sea, or a sea
	to an adjacent sea, or a sea to an adjacent port city.</li>
<li><i>Rail moves</i>: The maximum
	distance that can be moved via rail is determined by the
	sum of the round number (0..366) and the Hunter number
	(0..3) <ul>
<li>sum mod 4 is 0: No train move is permitted for
		the Hunter this turn.</li> 
<li>sum mod 4 is 1: The Hunter
		may move to any city adjacent to the current city
		via a rail link.</li> 
<li>sum mod 4 is 2: The Hunter
		may move to any city adjacent to the current city
		via a rail link, or any city adjacent via rail to
		such a city.</li> 
<li>sum mod 4 is 3: The Hunter may
		move to any city adjacent to the current city via
		a rail link, or any city adjacent via rail to such
		a city, or any city adjacent via rail to such a
		city. (i.e. move up to three steps by rail)
		<ul>
<li><i>when the rail move
			is to a non-adjacent city the Hunter does
			not actually enter the intermediate cities,
			so any encounters there do not occur</i></li>
		</ul> </li>
	</ul> </li>
</ul>

<h3>Hunter's Action</h3>

<p>At the start of the <b>ACTION</b> phase of any Hunter's turn:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the Hunter arrives in any city in Dracula's trail, then ...
	<ul>
	<li> <i>all</i> Hunters can see which positions in the trail
	have <b>MOVE</b>s that resulted in Dracula being in that city
	(they cannot see the actual moves)</li>
	<li> the Hunter encounters, in sequence, all Traps
	for that city which are in the current trail, then any
	immature Vampires, and then at last confronts Dracula himself
	if he is also in the city. Each of these events occurs
	in turn until either the Hunter is reduced to 0 or less
	life points or all the encounters have occurred.</li>
	<ul>
	<li>When a Trap is encountered the Hunter instantly
		loses 2 life points and the Trap is destroyed.
		<ul>
		<li>If there is more than one Trap at a
			location the Hunter encounters the Traps
			one at a time until either the Hunter is
			reduced to 0 or less life points, or until
			all the Traps are encountered, whichever
			occurs first.</li>
		</ul> </li> 
	<li>When an immature Vampire is encountered
		it is killed instantly with no effect to the
		Hunter. (well done!)</li> 
	<li>If Dracula
		is encountered then he instantly loses 10 blood
		points and the Hunter instantly loses 4 life
		points.</li>
	</ul>  
	</ul>
</li><li>Whenever a Hunter is reduced to 0 or less
	life points they are instantly automagically teleported to
	the Hospital of St Joseph and St Mary (and can do nothing
	else for the remainder of their turn)
	<ul>
	<li>while in the hospital, they have zero life points</li>
	<li>on their next turn, they have 9 life points again and can leave the hospital</li>
	<li>the magical teleportation to the hospital does not show up in
		the game history; players will have to deduce that
		they are in the hospital.</li>
	</ul> </li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the <b>ACTION</b> phase of any Hunter's turn:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the Hunter is in the same city or sea they were in
	last turn, they are treated as resting, researching or
	recovering from combat. The Hunter gains 3 life points
    by doing this (up to a maximum of 9 points).
</li></ul>

<h2>Dracula's Turn</h2>

<ul>
	
<li>The Hunters can see Dracula's location whenever he ends his turn
	in his castle, or in a city currently occupied by a Hunter
 <ul>
 <li>this holds even if his most recent move was a <b>HIDE</b></li> 
 <li>even if a Hunter is already at the location Dracula
		has moved to, no encounter occurs at this time, as
		dealing with encounters only happens in the action
		part of a <i>Hunter's</i> turn</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dracula's move</h3>

<ul>
<li>If the trail is already full (i.e. has 6 moves in it),
	 then the oldest <b>MOVE</b> in the trail is first
	removed from the trail
	<ul>
	<li>when a <b>MOVE</b> leaves the trail
	its corresponding encounter is treated as follows:
		<ul>
		<li>if it was a Trap it just vanishes without a trace (yay!)</li> 
		<li>if it was a Vampire it has <i>matured</i>  (eek!)</li>
		</ul> </li>
	</ul> </li>
<li>If there is no legal move possible for Dracula he
	automagically Teleports to Castle Dracula as his 
	<b>MOVE</b></li> 
<li>
	Each non-teleport <b>MOVE</b> by Dracula is either a
	<b>LOCATION</b>, a <b>HIDE</b>, or a <b>DOUBLE_BACK</b>
	<ul>
	<li> Any <b>LOCATION</b> move must be to a location that is
	<em>adjacent</em> to his current location, except that ...
		<ul>
		<li> it <em>cannot</em> be a location in his most recent 5 moves</li>
		<li><i>adjacent</i> does not include by rail (Dracula never travels by rail)</li>
		<li> he can never move to the hospital of St Joseph and St Mary</li>
	</ul> </li> 
<li>A <b>HIDE</b> move means he stays in the same city he was in at the
	start of his turn, except ...</li>
	<ul>
	<li>he <em>cannot</em> make a <b>HIDE</b> move if he already has
		a <b>HIDE</b> move in his trail</li>
	<li>he <em>cannot</em> <b>HIDE</b> at sea </li>
	</ul>  
<li>A <b>DOUBLE_BACK</b> move is a move to a location adjacent to
	his current location and which is currently in his trail, except ...
	<ul>
	<li>he <em>cannot</em> make a <b>DOUBLE_BACK</b> move if he already
		has a <b>DOUBLE_BACK</b> move in his trail</li>
	<li>if he makes a <b>DOUBLE_BACK</b> move, the Hunters know ...
		<ul>
		<li>that his most recent move is a <b>DOUBLE_BACK</b></li>
		<li>the position in the trail of the location he has doubled back to</li>
		</ul>
	</li></ul> </li> 
	</ul>
</li></ul>

<h3>Dracula's Action</h3>

<ul>
<li>Dracula's current <b>MOVE</b> is placed in the trail.</li>
<li>If Dracula is at sea he loses two blood points.
	<ul>
	<li>Hunters know whenever Dracula is at sea.</li>
	</ul> </li> 
<li>If he is in a city Dracula places an <i>Encounter</i> in that city.
	<ul>
	<li>An Encounter is either an Trap or an immature Vampire.</li> 
	<li>Dracula places an immature Vampire
		if he is in a city AND if the number of the round
		is divisible by 13 (ie in round 0, then in round
		13, then 26, and so on).</li> 
	<li>Otherwise, if there are currently less than 3 Traps in that city,
		he places a Trap.</li> 
	<li>Dracula cannot place an Encounter at sea.</li> 
	<li>Dracula <i>can</i> place an encounter for a 
		<b>HIDE</b> or <b>DOUBLE_BACK</b> or teleport
		move to a city location (possibly making two or
		more Encounters for that city so long as the
		previous <b>MOVE</b>(s) remain in the trail).</li>
	</ul> </li> 
<li>The game score is reduced by 1 point.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Special Rules</h2>

<h3>Research</h3>

<ul>
<li>If a Hunter rests, and each of the other Hunters rested
	in their most recent turn, then we say they have been doing
	<i>collaborative research</i>, and the 6th move in Dracula's
	trail is immediately revealed.
	<ul>
	<li>nothing is revealed if there are not yet 6 moves in the trail</li>
	</ul> </li>
</ul>

<h3>HIDE or DOUBLE_BACK moves</h3>

<ul>
<li>If a Hunter enters a city for which a <b>HIDE</b> or <b>DOUBLE_BACK</b>
	is still in the trail, then all Hunters learn that the move was a 
	<b>HIDE</b> or <b>DOUBLE_BACK</b>, and they also learn
	(recursively if doubling back to a <b>HIDE</b>, etc.) the nature of
	the move to which the <b>HIDE</b> or <b>DOUBLE_BACK</b> relates.</li>
<li>If the Hunters research a <b>HIDE</b> or <b>DOUBLE_BACK</b> move, then
	all Hunters learn that the move was a
	<b>HIDE</b> or <b>DOUBLE_BACK</b>, and they also learn
	(recursively if doubling back to a <b>HIDE</b>, etc.) the nature of
	the move to which the <b>HIDE</b> or <b>DOUBLE_BACK relates</b>.</li>
<li>The Hunters can see whenever the sixth move in the trail is
	a <b>HIDE</b> move, but this does not mean that they learn the
	nature of the move to which it relates (because that move is
	no longer in the trail)</li>
</ul>

<h3>No more secrets</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Hunters can co-operate using messages to rid the
	world of Dracula as swiftly as possible.</li> 
<li>Sadly Dracula gets to hear everything the Hunters say to each other.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Extra Rules</h3>

<ul>
<li>Dracula cannot place an Encounter in a city if there
	are already 3 Encounters in that city.</li>
</ul>
